Hello to all who come across this page!!!!

My name is Aaron Kann, and I decided to spend my summer analyzing data amongst soccer leagues, in order to be able to better spot descrepancies between betting lines and reality. 
I also had some questions about soccer data that I wanted to answer in an informed way!

Within this repository lie three unique questions about soccer data that I wanted answers.  

The first is about individual hot streaks.  On the prizepicks user inferface, data is shown for a players last 5 games, and users often will use this data to make bets as it is the most accessible data to them.
I wondered if a player's last 5 statlines were more accurate, less accurate, or about the same in determining future outcomes as opposed to season long averages.

The second is about a stat called Expected Goals(xG).  In soccer, xG is a stat that measures how likely a player is to score, based on the shot location, shot type, and relative player positioning.  
In my opinion, it is often used incorrectly as a barometer for player excellence, while it shouldn't be because it doesn't measure a player's finishing ability.
In my study, I wondered if a players second half goalscoring output is more accurately predicted by first half xG, or first half goals scored.

The final one (so far) is about a player's previous year statistics.  At the very beginning of a season, it can be hard to determine if a player's statistical improvement is a measure of variable noise
or truly a sustainable improvement.  I seeked to determine if there was a definitive point where a player's to date statistics were a better predictor of future outcomes than a player's previous year statistics
(i.e. a point where a player's change in stats can be considered legitimate).
